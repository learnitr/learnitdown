\description{
The \code{\link[=webshot_shiny]{webshot_shiny()}} function is designed to create the screenshot image of
a Shiny application, with an icon suggesting to click on it for launching
the application. The image created can then be used by \code{\link[=launch_shiny]{launch_shiny()}} in
a bookdown to differ the start of Shiny application, while displaying useful
information to the user (how the Shiny application would look like if it was
started).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# We wait 10 sec to make sure it is loaded when the screenshot is taken
(webshot_shiny("https://phgrosjean.shinyapps.io/histogram/", delay = 10))
 # Now, look at this image. You can use it with launch_shiny()
